# Thanks for working with us :smile:

We've written this document to help you work with us. We've done our best to make the process as simple as possible for you, so you can concentrate on the Theming work we've given you.

## Accessing the code repository

We host our WordPress repositories within our Bitbucket account. So, if you don't already have one you'll need to [create an account now](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/). Once you've done that, send us your Bitbucket username and we'll grant you access to the relevant repository.

## Cloning the repository

We'll have a specific branch for you to `clone`. We'll give you the details when you start the project. This will be the same branch you `push` your work back to.

## Installing the code

We only version control the project's Theme and Plugins, not the WordPress core. So that's `wp-content/` downwards. Therefore you'll need to clone the repository into a working WordPress install that you already have set up.

## Installing the database

So that the Plugins work and so that you have some seed data to work with, we'll supply you with a database when you start the project.
