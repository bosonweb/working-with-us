# Making Changes

Each Theme we build is built on top of [Startline](https://github.com/ninefortyone/startline). Startline  acts as a starting point for new themes that use both Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome. It also comes bundled with the HTML5 Shiv and Respond.js utilities. The CSS is written using Sass.
