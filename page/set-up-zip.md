# Thanks for working with us :smile:

We've written this document to help you work with us. We've done our best to make the process as simple as possible for you, so you can concentrate on the Theming work we've given you.

## Accessing the code

We'll send you a ZIP of the latest version of the project's code.

## Installing the code

We only work with the project's Theme and Plugins, not the WordPress core. So that's `wp-content/` downwards. Therefore you'll need to unzip the code into a working WordPress install that you already have set up.

## Installing the database

So that the Plugins work and so that you have some seed data to work with, we'll supply you with a database when you start the project (if applicable).
